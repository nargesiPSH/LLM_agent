This project features an interactive agent powered by GPT-Mini (40-mini) designed to help employees better understand and manage their back health. Created as part of a public exhibition at London Design Week, participants engage in real-time conversations with the model, which is fine-tuned based on our research on back health.
The user interface (UI) was built from scratch using Python's Tkinter, offering an intuitive platform for users to explore health-related insights. The large language model (LLM) facilitates a continuous stream of dialogue to make research-backed recommendations accessible.
